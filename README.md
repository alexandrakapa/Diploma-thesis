# Abstract
This diploma thesis deals with the topic of Î•motion Recognition and Valence/Arousal
Detection using Machine Learning methods and extracting information from face images.
The field of sentiment analysis is a very active research field with a large number of
applications in our daily life.

We approached this problem by making use of Convolutional Neural Networks by
also exploiting the data augmentation method in order to get a larger amount of data.
The methodology we implemented couples two problems, a classification problem and
a regression problem, where it exploits the labels of valence/arousal in order to lead to
better performance in the classification problem.

The labels are provided by the dataset we used, called Affectnet, which consists of a
large number of images depicting human expressions that have been labeled with respect
to emotion, valence and arousal. Regarding the emotion labels, they belong to one of 8
distinct categories: Neutral, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Fear, Disgust, Anger, Contempt while
the valence and arousal labels are decimal numbers in the range [-1,1].

Having experimentally applied our methodology, we then train our models and finally
we evaluate them on the given dataset.
